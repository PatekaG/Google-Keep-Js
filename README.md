# Google-Keep-Js

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my **Google Keep clone** built with JavaScript. Itâ€™s a simple project where you can add, edit, and delete notes â€” just like Google Keep! I created it to practice web development and experiment with some fun JavaScript features.

## How to Run
1. **Clone or download the project** from GitHub.
2. Go ahead and open the `index.html` file in your browser (any modern one will do â€” Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
3. Enjoy adding your own notes!

## Features
- **Add notes**: Create and save your thoughts in a clean interface.
- **Edit notes**: Modify your notes whenever you need to.
- **Delete notes**: If something isnâ€™t working for you, just delete it.

## Requirements
- A **web browser** (Chrome or Firefox recommended).
- **No complicated setup** - just download and open it.

## Author
**Pateka Gcwabe** â€” I'm a self-taught developer, always exploring and learning new things.
